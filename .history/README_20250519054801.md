MLFQ Simulation Frontend
A modern web application for visualizing and simulating the Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) CPU scheduling algorithm.

<img alt="MLFQ Simulation Screenshot" src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=MLFQ+Simulation+Screenshot">
Overview
This repository contains the frontend codebase for the MLFQ Simulation project, which provides an interactive way to understand and experiment with the Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduling algorithm. The application allows users to create processes with different characteristics, configure queue parameters, and visualize the scheduling behavior in real-time.

Features
Interactive Process Creation: Add and configure processes with custom parameters (arrival time, burst time, etc.)
Real-time Visualization: Watch the MLFQ algorithm in action with dynamic visualizations
Gantt Chart Display: View process execution timeline in an interactive Gantt chart
Algorithm Configuration: Customize MLFQ parameters such as time quantum and aging
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing
Responsive Design: Works across desktop and mobile devices
Tech Stack
Frontend
Framework: Next.js (React)
Language: TypeScript
Styling: TailwindCSS
UI Components: Shadcn UI
Animations: Framer Motion
Forms: React Hook Form with Zod validation
Backend Integration
This frontend interfaces with our MLFQ Simulation Backend, which is built with:
